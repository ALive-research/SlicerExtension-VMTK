VMTK in 3D Slicer 4
-------------------

1)

To install, do the following until the extensions are available through the wizard in Slicer4:

git clone https://haehn@github.com/haehn/VMTK-in-3D-Slicer.git
cd VMTK-in-3D-Slicer
mkdir SlicerVmtk4-build
cd SlicerVmtk4-build
ccmake -DSlicer_DIR:PATH=/path/to/Slicer4-Superbuild/Slicer-build ../SlicerVmtk4
make -j 4
/path/to/Slicer4-Superbuild/Slicer-build/Slicer --add-loadable-extension-path SlicerVmtk4 "/path/to/SlicerVmtk4-build"


The VMTK libraries get fetched through a Superbuild External mechanism.

2)

For now, the SlicerVmtk4/Modules/ sub-directory has to be copied to /path/to/Slicer4/QTScriptedModules/.

Then, it has to be added to /path/to/Slicer4/QTScriptedModules/CMakeLists.txt like this:

 ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(Modules)


Cheers!
